# **Creative Brief: Branchless Bank**

### Client Background
My client is Branchless Bank, which is an online-only bank offering full banking services without brick-and-mortar locations. Strengths include very little overhead, 24-hour access that is inexpensive to provide, the ability to allocate money to customer service, social network integrations, and high convenience. Weaknesses include greater allocations to fighting identity theft and fraud, very little human contact, and a potential for high ATM fees. Branchless Bank's mission is to create a client-oriented, not-evil banking experience that laughs in the face of Big Banking. 

### Project Overview
The project is to design the iOS online banking app for Branchless bank. The design is needed because the bank will rely mainly on the app as its interface. The opportunity is to make a very clean, user-centered design for a very "now" and user-focused product. 

### Project Drivers
The project's goals and objectives are to create the most intuitive possible app that is a pleasure to use. It will have a few simple screens in this stage. 

### Target Audience
The target audience is the same exact target audience of Venmo. Beginning with the under-35 group and then spreading out to encompass people of all ages who will be secondary adopters. Parents should learn of the app from their children. 

### Competitor Analysis
Ally Bank is the biggest direct competitor. Ally has a "fun" feel, but not necessarily a trustworthy tone. Use of images and colors are playful, and not serious. They are the most-used online bank, but they seem to have gone too far in the opposite direction in their tone. Branchless is differentiated with a professional and sleek/high-design tone but interested in being the "opposite of Big Banking."

### Targeted Message
The message is that this is a bank that rejects the need to bank with Big Banking and gives the customer back the control. The latest Wells Fargo scandal is the perfect example of what Branchless is NOT. This is touched-upon by online-only banks but it needs to be driven home by Branchless.
